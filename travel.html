			<h2>My story</h2>

			<h3> When I was younger my mom always told me that I should become an aupair student, but I was too scared and too shy to actually go out and discover the world. But when I grew older my point of view changed and I started to re-think my moms idea.</h3>

			<h3> First I was looking for a summerjob in a foreign country. My mom was okay with it, but she came wit a much better idea. She asked me "Why don't you take a year of and go for a few months somewhere to improve your english. I was like "you crazy", but it wasn't such a bad idea, so I just decided to do it.</h3>

			<h3>So I did it, 6 september 2013 I stepped on that plane that changed my life forever, after a really long flight and a huge jetlag I arrived in Brisbane, Australia. It was there where my adventure started. I've spent 7 months there, made amazing friends over the whole world and saw many great things, but I wanted to see more. So I left Australia and continued my journey.</h3>

			<h3> After agai,n a way too long flight, another jetlag and so on, I landed in Los Angeles, California. I only stayed here for 2 months, but also had an amazing time overhere with great stories to tell! </h3>
